KBeast (Kernel Beast) is new kernel rootkit based on the publicly known rootkit, modification is made in order to support kernel 2.6.16, 2.6.18, 2.6.32, and 2.6.35. Actually it should work for kernel 2.6.9 up to 2.6.35 or more, but our installer script is only created for 2.6.16, 2.6.18, 2.6.32, and 2.6.35.
